# neddo.dev - My Personal Website

This is a VERY basic personal little website. Don't expect the most advanced code or whatever. Threw it together rather quick.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
